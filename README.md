<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you assinged a hotkey via the normal WoW-hotkey settings, you can use the hotkey to display the loot for the focused lootable NPC.</p>
<p>You can also use the /lt-chat commant for a macro.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A window will open showing the drops sorted by dropchance in decending order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The item-tooltip will show on hover/mouseover and the links are clickable, which will post the normal WoW-itemlink in chat via console.</p>
